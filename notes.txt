Class based Components :- 
the render ensures that the component should behave as a react component
Function based Components :- 

props :- props a concept in which helps  parent component to pass data to child component

 2  ways 
 1 .as an attribute of element 
 2 .between the element 
  

  this will refer to class .
  super method is used to call the constructor of the parent class



  Component Life cycle method has 3  phases 

mounting - the component becomes available on the dom 
{we merge two objects with the help of spread operator }

1. Constructor() -  can initialise the state of the component 
2. getDerivedStateFromProps() - here we set the state data using the data coming from the parent component
3. render() - it is used to return the JSX so can see the view on the mount 
4. ComponentDidMount() - gives confirmation that the component is available on the DOM
                        - Can amke api calls to get some data   
                        - can run some custom logic 
  
  
  
updating -  the component gets updated foloowing the user interaction
   
   
 un-mounting   - Removal from the dom
